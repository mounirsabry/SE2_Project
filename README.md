Detailed.
  On this project we build web services to enable e-commerce application for customers to buy and sell goods online.
The project uses maven for handling dependenices and uses docker for simplifing the installation and testing process.

The implemented Features.
Three types of users.
the admin user which has access to all the data and privilegios on the application.
The shop owner user which can add shop(s) to the application either physical(on-site) or virtual(online) to the application.
Using these shops, the shop owner can add goods to sell online.
The customer or normal user which can buy these goods from the shop owner.

MySQL.
We have implemented MySQL as our database which can accesses locally, however we doesn't restrict the DBMS used.
You can implement any DBMS you want either online or local as long as you keep the same interface.
All you have to do is to extend the AccountStorage abstract class with  you class of choice and then modify the created instances in 
account_system package's interfaces.

What might be added later.
Add and manage shops to the application.
We will add the ability to add and manage the shops in the application as a shop owner.

Purchase items from the application.
After you login to the application as a normal user, you can buy goods and items and buy using any available paying methods.

Statistics.
You can have some statistics about the informatinon in the application, like how many items you purchase or sell.
What is the number of customers and shop owners in the application, and other information.
